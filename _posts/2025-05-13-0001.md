## $$\text{\sect}$$2 ORDERD SETS

### 1.5 Definition

Let $$S$$ be a set. An *order* on $$S$$ is a relation, denoted by $$<$$, with the following two properties:  
(i) if $$x \in S$$ and $$y \in S$$ then one of and only one ofthe statements  
<center>$$x < y$$</center>
<center>$$x = y$$</center>
<center>$$x > y$$</center>
is true.  
(ii) if $$x, y, z \in S$$, if $$x < y$$ and $$y < z$$, then $$x < z$$.  

### 1.6 Definition 

An *ordered set* is a set $$S$$ in which an order is defined.  
For example, $$Q$$ is an orded set if $$r < s$$ is defined to mean that $$s - r$$ is a positive rational number.

### 1.7 Definition

Suppose $$S$$ is an orded set, and $$E \subset S$$. If there exists a $$\beta \in S$$ such that $$x \le \beta$$ for every $$x \in E$$, we say that $$E$$ is *bounded above*, and call $$\beta$$ an *upper bound* of $$E$$.  
Lower bounds are defined in the same way (with $$\ge$$ in place of $$\le$$)

### 1.8 Definition

Suppose *S* is an ordered set, $$E \subset S$$, and *E* is bounded above.  
Suppose there exists an $$\alpha \in S$$ with the following properties:  
(i) $$\alpha$$ is an upper bound of *E*.  
(ii) if $$\gamma \lt \alpha$$ the $$\gamma$$ is not an upper bound of *E*.  
Then $$\alpha$$ is called the *least upper bound of E* or the *supremum of E*, and we write  
<center>$$\alpha = sup E$$</center>
The *greatest lower bound*, or *infimum*, of a set *E* which is bounded bleow is defined in the same manner: The statement
<center>$$\alpha = inf E$$</center>
means that $$\alpha$$ is a lower bound of *E* and that no $$\beta$$ wiht $$\beta \gt \alpha$$ is a lower bound of *E*.  

Note that there is at most one supremum/infimum for each bounded above/below set.
