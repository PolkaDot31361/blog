# 1 THE REAL AND COMPLEX NUMBER SYSTEMS

## INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Example
Prove that  
(1)<center>$$p^{2} = 2$$</center>  
is not satisfied by any rational p.

#### Proof
Assume that p is a rational number such that $$p = m/n$$ where $$m$$ and $$n$$ are relatively prime and $$n \not = 0$$.  
Then (1) implies  
<center>$$m^{2} = 2n^{2}$$</center>  
$$\implies m^{2}$$ is even.  
$$\implies m$$ is even (If $$m$$ were odd, $$m^{2}$$ would be odd).  
$$\implies m$$ is divisible by 4.  
$$\implies 2n^{2}$$ is also divisible by 4.  
$$\implies n^{2}$$ is even.  
$$\implies n$$ is even.  
This contradicts the assumption that $$m, n$$ are relatively prime.  
Hence $$p^{2} = 2$$ is impossible for rational $$p$$.

Let $$A$$ be the set of all positive rationals $$p$$ such taht $$p^{2} < 2$$ and let $$B$$ consists of all positive rationasl $$p$$ such that $$p^{2} > 2$$.  
We shall show taht *A contains no largest number and B contains no smallest.*  

More explicitly, for every *p* in *A* we can find a rational *q* in *A* such taht $$p < q$$, and for every *p* in *B* we can find a rational *q* in *B* such taht $$q < p$$.  
To do this, we associate with each rational $$p > 0$$ the number  
(3)<center>$$q = p - {\frac {p^{2} - 2} {p + 2}} = \frac {2p + 2} {p +2}$$</center>
